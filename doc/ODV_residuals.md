Processing residuals with ODV
A short tutorial on how to work with the residuals provided along with the analysis.
File: Water body phosphate_monthly_residuals.nc
ODV version: 5.4.0


Open the netCDF file containing the residuals




Follow the Wizard steps




Leave variables and metadata




Use decimal date (or dummy variable) as Primary variable




Finish the netCDF setup





Select a Surface window in Views




Result of the Surface window. Here you can change the dot size (Properties) and other details





Set the z-variable as the residuals
























Set the ranges for the residuals, for instance between -5. and 5.









Use the sample filter to display only the points with a high value for the residual.
For example we show residuals above 5.




12. Example of what is obtained with the filter




13. Select your region of interest using the Set ranges.
In this case we can see the measurements in the Black Sea for which the residuals exceed a 5 Âµmol/l.
